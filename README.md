# team-profile-gen

  ## Description

  I have built a team generator command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team. The user can input any number of team members, which consist of a mix of engineers, interns, and a manager. This assignment passes all unit tests and once all questions have been answered the user will create an HTML file that displays a the team heiarchy.
